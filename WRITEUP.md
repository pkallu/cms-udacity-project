### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 
For this particular app, it was an easy decision for me to go with App service. Here are are the points influeced my decision 
1. For this particalar excersize, I wouldn't need compute power more than what app service can offer. 
2. Azure has automated deloyment option to deploy code using github actions to App service. 
3. Azure app service has free tier that I can use for deploying a web app

All the above points made me choose app service over virtual machine
